# Insurance-Charge-Prediction
It is always good to predict the insurance amount for an person. But the catch is, this amount varies from person to person as not all the person
have the same health issues. Some may be healthy, whilst others may have moderate to fatal diseases. So it is only fair that the charges is calculated
based on the health and other aspects of a person. In this dataset, we take into account, the sex, age, whether a person smokes or not, whether he/she have
any children, the region where the person lives etc.. After preprocessing the dataset and removing the unwanted features, the linear regression algorithm
is applied for prediciting the insurance charges.
